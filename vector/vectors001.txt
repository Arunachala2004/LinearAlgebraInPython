A vector is an ordered collection of scalars. It can be represented in two forms:

Column vector: Contains n rows and 1 column
Row vector: Contains 1 row and n columns
The number of scalars in a vector is called its dimension or order. 

Example: A column vector 'u' of dimension 2 is illustrated below:



Example: A row vector 'v' of dimension 3 is illustrated below:
