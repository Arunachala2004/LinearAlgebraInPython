Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and their representations using vectors and matrices. It’s a fundamental subject in several areas of engineering, and it’s a prerequisite to a deeper understanding of machine learning.

To work with linear algebra in Python, you can count on SciPy, which is an open-source Python library used for scientific computing, including several modules for common tasks in science and engineering.

Of course, SciPy includes modules for linear algebra, but that’s not all. It also offers optimization, integration, interpolation, and signal processing capabilities. It’s part of the SciPy stack, which includes several other packages for scientific computing, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, SymPy, IPython, and pandas.

scipy.linalg includes several tools for working with linear algebra problems, including functions for performing matrix calculations, such as determinants, inverses, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and the singular value decomposition

Here I am starting my learning journey towards Machine Learning.
